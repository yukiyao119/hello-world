# hello-world
my very first repository

Hi Crowds,

I am Yuki, fresh Mainer. I was considered a talker, a communicator. Now English becomes my daily language, I find it harder to be as communicative(humorous) as I used to be. Luckily, as a life-long learner, I started to explore the world with photography, coding and designing now.
